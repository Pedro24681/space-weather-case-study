# Outputs

This folder stores generated artifacts produced by the notebooks. Or the PNG's put simply.

Typical contents
- `figures/` — PNGs and other image assets used in reports and presentations.
- `processed/` — cleaned and merged datasets (CSV) used across phases.
- `results/` — summary statistics, tables, and intermediate result files.
- `reports/` — exported reports (optional).

Notes
- The notebooks save final figures and processed CSVs to this folder. When sharing the repository, keep key final figures and summary CSVs to illustrate results.
- Large or sensitive raw data files should remain in `data/` and can be truncated or sampled if needed for public sharing.
