# NYC 311 Response Analysis

This project explores and analyzes data from NYC's 311 Service Requests.  
My goal is to practice loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing real-world data using code.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Datasets used for analysis
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks with analysis code and results
- `src/`: Python scripts for data processing

## Getting Started

1. Download 311 data (see `/data/README.md`)
2. Open `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` to follow the analysis
3. Read comments and explanations in the code to learn more!

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib or seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
