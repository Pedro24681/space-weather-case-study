# Space Weather Case Study

This project analyzes key geomagnetic storm triggers using satellite and Kp index data, demonstrating a full scientific workflow: data integration, event detection, and impact assessment through reproducible notebooks and professional visualizations.

## Repository Structure

- **notebooks/** – Main Jupyter notebooks for each analysis phase
- **src/** – Python modules for data loading, analysis, and plotting
- **data/** – All original input datasets
- **outputs/** – Generated visualizations, processed data, and results

## Key Phases

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (Phase 1)
2. Data Integration & Merging (Phase 2)
3. Event Detection & Storm Cataloging (Phase 3)
4. Impact Assessment & Visualization (Phase 4)

## How to Run

1. Install requirements:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open JupyterLab or Notebook in the `notebooks/` folder
3. Run notebooks in order from `01-data-load-and-eda.ipynb` to `04-impact-assessment.ipynb`

## Project Results

See `ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md` for full key findings and report.
