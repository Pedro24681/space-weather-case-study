# NYC 311 Response Analysis

Hello to whoever may see this. This project explores and analyzes data from NYC's 311 Service Requests.  
My goal is to put into practice loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing real-world data using code based on everything I've learned through certifications for data analytics.


## Project Structure

- `data/`: Datasets used for analysis
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks with analysis code and results
- `src/`: Python scripts for data processing

## Getting Started

1. Download 311 data (see `/data/README.md`)
2. Open `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` to follow the analysis
3. Read comments and explanations in the code to learn more!

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib or seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
