## 🎯 Executive Summary

This analysis examines geomagnetic activity (Kp index) data to understand space weather patterns and their potential impact on technology infrastructure. The study analyzes space weather conditions over a 9-day period in November 2025, identifying patterns, storm events, and risk probabilities.

### Key Findings:
- ✅ Analyzed 73 three-hourly time periods of geomagnetic activity
- ✅ Identified 1 severe geomagnetic storm event (Kp ≥ 7)
- ✅ Average Kp index: 2.86 (quiet to unsettled conditions)
- ✅ Peak activity: Kp = 7.0 on November 12, 2025

## 📈 Analysis Overview

### Dataset Information
- **Source:** GFZ Potsdam Space Weather Prediction Center
- **Time Period:** November 10-18, 2025 (9 days)
- **Data Points:** 73 three-hourly measurements
- **Variables Analyzed:** Kp index (median, min, max, quantiles, probabilities)

### What is the Kp Index?
The Kp index is a global measure of geomagnetic activity on a scale of 0-9:
- **0-2:** Quiet conditions
- **3-4:** Unsettled to active
- **5:** Minor geomagnetic storm
- **6:** Moderate storm
- **7:** Strong storm
- **8-9:** Severe to extreme storms

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 1. Overall Activity Profile
- **Highest Kp Recorded:** 7.0 (Strong geomagnetic storm)
- **Lowest Kp Recorded:** 0.33
- **Average Kp:** 2.86 (Generally quiet conditions)
- **Standard Deviation:** 1.73 (Moderate variability)

### 2. Storm Events Identified
- **Moderate Storms (Kp ≥ 5):** 4 occurrences
- **Severe Storms (Kp ≥ 6):** 3 occurrences  
- **Strong Storms (Kp ≥ 7):** 1 occurrence (November 12, 2025)

### 3. Risk Analysis
Based on probability distributions, the study period showed:
- **High probability** of Kp 4-5 (active conditions) during certain periods
- **Elevated risk** of Kp 6-7 (strong storms) on November 12
- **Low overall probability** of extreme events (Kp ≥ 8)

## 📊 Visualizations

### Visualization 1: Kp Index Time Series
![Kp Index Over Time](outputs/figures/01_kp_index_timeseries.png)

**Insights:**
- Clear baseline of quiet conditions (Kp 2-3) throughout most of the period
- Significant spike on November 12, reaching Kp = 7.0
- Rapid return to baseline after storm event
- Pattern suggests single solar event rather than sustained activity

---

### Visualization 2: Kp Distribution Analysis
![Kp Distribution](outputs/figures/02_kp_distribution.png)

**Insights:**
- The shaded area shows the full range of possible Kp values
- Red line (median) closely tracks actual conditions
- 25th-75th percentile range shows narrow uncertainty most of the time
- Wide uncertainty band during the November 12 event indicates forecast challenge

---

### Visualization 3: Probability Analysis
![Probability Analysis](outputs/figures/03_probability_analysis.png)

**Insights:**
- Different Kp ranges show varying probability over time
- November 12 shows elevated probability for severe conditions
- Most time periods show highest probability for Kp 4-5 (yellow line)
- Extreme events (Kp ≥ 8, dark red) remain consistently low probability

## 💼 Business/Technology Impact Assessment

### Potential Impacts During Storm Event (Kp = 7.0):

#### 🛰️ **Satellite Operations**
- **Risk Level:** MODERATE TO HIGH
- **Potential Issues:** 
  - Increased atmospheric drag on low-Earth orbit satellites
  - GPS/GNSS positioning errors up to several meters
  - Satellite orientation/tracking anomalies
- **Recommendation:** Enhanced monitoring during storm periods

#### 📡 **Communications**
- **Risk Level:** MODERATE
- **Potential Issues:**
  - HF (high-frequency) radio degradation at high latitudes
  - Possible aurora-related interference
- **Recommendation:** Have backup communication protocols ready

#### ⚡ **Power Grid**
- **Risk Level:** LOW TO MODERATE
- **Potential Issues:**
  - Induced currents in long transmission lines (high latitudes)
  - Transformer stress (minimal at Kp = 7)
- **Recommendation:** Monitor grid stability in vulnerable regions

#### ✈️ **Aviation**
- **Risk Level:** LOW TO MODERATE
- **Potential Issues:**
  - Radiation exposure on polar routes (not significant at Kp = 7)
  - Minor navigation system fluctuations
- **Recommendation:** Standard operating procedures sufficient
