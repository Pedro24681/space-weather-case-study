# Source Code (`src/`)
This folder contains all Python modules used across the project notebooks:
- `data_loader.py`: Functions for loading and filtering space weather datasets.
- `plotting.py`: Custom visualization functions.
- `analysis.py`: Statistical routines and event classification.

These modules improve code organization and keep notebooks clean and reproducible.
